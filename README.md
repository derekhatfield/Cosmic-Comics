# Tech Elevator Final Capstone

This project was our team's final capstone project as part of the Tech Elevator bootcamp. This team consisted of myself and three other students and we worked together to create a fully-fledged web application. This application was developed in an two-week-long Agile environment, with daily meetings with our "Scrum Master" (our instructor), and bi-weekly meetings with our "Product Owner" (another member of Tech Elevator staff). 

This application is a comic book collection assistant, allowing users to create their own personal collections of comics from Marvel's public API. Users are able to register, sign in, create collections, search for comics through Marvel's comic API, and add whatever comics they wish to one of their collections.

We used a locally hosted database utilizing PostgreSQL, Java Spring Boot backend, and Vue.js frontend.

For my personal contributions, I worked primarily on the Java backend, but I did contribute some to the frontend as well.
